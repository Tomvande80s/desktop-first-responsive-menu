# Desktop First Responsive Menu

## About
Desktop first responsive menu using HTML and CSS. No JavaScript or input checkbox element. 

## How it works
Uses :target pseudo-class to open the menu on screen widths less than 780px. A menu close button, hidden by default, is used to shrink the menu when targeted.
